It is an iOS mobile application developed using Swift that is conceptually similar to Facebook Marketplace. Users can post advertisements to sell any items they wish that others can see on their home screen. The posts will be sorted by time, with the latest post on the top. While posting an advertisement, sellers need to include the item name, description, category, price, their contact number and a URL to the image of the product that is stored online. All these information will be visible to every user on their home screen.

The backend API was built using Flask and the data was being stored on Firebase.
